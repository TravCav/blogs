Throwing it in reverse
----------------------
This week we're throwing this blog into reverse and smashing the gas to discover why reverse for loops are faster. So in the spirit of going backwards, instead of C# and IL, we'll be using the language that C# stole all its best tricks from, Java and bytecode. 

Reverse loops have been around a long time but have mostly been forgotten or ignored because these days nobody's going to miss those extra few clock cycles. But let's see what we've given up and find out if we can determine when and if it ever matters.  First we're going to need some code in here to see what we're dealing with.

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Normal for loop we're all familiar with
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }

        // Reverse for loop
         for (int i = 10; i >= 0; i--) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}

Great. Amazing. A loop that counts from 0 to 10 and a loop that counts from 10 to 0.  Seems the same.  Going backwards seems silly. Why do that? The short answer is don't bother if it makes it less readable or is going to add more code inside the loop.  But if you're just looping through everything and don't care about order then you get some performance advantages.

Just like the  syntactical sugar of modern languages the for loop is also just short hand for a while loop. Take the following two loops for example. They both get compiled down to the exact same bytecode.

 for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }

 int i = 0;
        while (i < 10) {
            System.out.println(i);
            i++;
        }

They both get compiled down to this.

       0: iconst_0
       1: istore_0
       2: iload_0
       3: bipush        10
       5: if_icmpge     21
       8: getstatic     #2                  // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
      11: iload_0
      12: invokevirtual #3                  // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(I)V
      15: iinc          0, 1
      18: goto          2

A couple things to notice here.  Starting at line 2 we load in the variable onto the stack then on line 3 we put the number 10 to the stack and finally line 5 is comparing if the variable is greater than or equal to 10. At the end we loop back up with a goto 2. What!? A goto!?  Yeah goto's are fine, at this level their not the demons we've been taught to avoid, they just can't be trusted in the hands of high level language developers. While loops in ever language eventually get turned into a goto or some other similar branching instruction.

Ok great it loops.  But lines 3 and 5 are slowing us down here.  Every time we loop we have to put the number 10 back onto the stack again then we have to compare the two numbers.  It's even worse if you replace the 10 with a more complex action like getting the length of an array. Then you're doing that action all over again at the top of every loop. Every. Single. Loop.  Putting 10 on the stack isn't so bad but if you're looping through a few hundred thousand elements then that's  a few hundred thousand times it has to put 10 on the stack or whatever functionality you put there. Sure a few hundred thousand extra instructions probably isn't the worst thing in the world, but if you put a function there that takes an extra millisecond then you've just added minutes to your code.  And hey if you're bothering to use a reverse for then you care about those cycles.

So how is a reverse for any better. Let's look at it in while loop form and then we'll jump into some bytecode in a bit again.

int i = 10;
        while (i >= 0) {
            System.out.println(i);
            i--;
        }

We've now moved the 10 out of the loop. We can even make it a function and it won't matter.  But you're probably looking at that 0 and say to yourself, "yeah but you still have to push the 0 onto the stack every time and do a compare".  Not exactly.  0 is a nice number to work with.  It's much easier to check that a number is not 0 especially at the binary level than to check if 4 is bigger than or the same as 10.  That's like real math stuff there.  Okay let's see how that works out in the bytecode.

Woooo! Only 9 instructions instead of 10! Gotta go fast!  
      21: bipush        10
      23: istore_0
      24: iload_0
      25: ifle          41
      28: getstatic     #2                  // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
      31: iload_0
      32: invokevirtual #3                  // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(I)V
      35: iinc          0, -1
      38: goto          24

How did we save an instruction just by reversing the loop? Start at the beginning there.  Out the gate we throw 10 onto the stack.  Or potentially the result of some function. Then at the end we see the loop starts on line 24. So if an instruction is getting taken out of the loop, then what are we putting in the loop to compare to 0?  Nothing. On line 25 we just check if the counter is less than or equal to 0. Zeros are easy. Bigger numbers gotta be remembered and you gotta do math to compare them. It's just awful.  We've not just removed an instruction. We've removed an instruction from inside the loop and replaced it with another one that's much more efficient.  The key here also being that we've moved work outside the loop.  And this works the same way in just about every language. But you'll probably never notice a difference unless you're doing 100's of thousands or millions of loops.  Usually nested loops are a good place to look where it might be needed.  Also if you have to do extra code in your loop to adjust for it being backwards you'll end up putting slowdowns back in.  But I'll keep harping on the moving things outside the loop.

Just to drive the point home a bit, how often have you seen this? Looping through an array and doing something for each element using the length of the array.  

String[] someWords = {"Hello", "World"};
        
        for (int i = 0; i < someWords.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(someWords[i]);
        }

      15: iconst_0
      16: istore_2
      17: iload_2
      18: aload_1
      19: arraylength
      20: if_icmpge     38
      23: getstatic     #5                  // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
      26: aload_1
      27: iload_2
      28: aaload
      29: invokevirtual #6                  // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
      32: iinc          2, 1
      35: goto          17


After looping back to line 17, the array object has to get loaded back onto the stack at line 18, and the length has to be retrieved again on line 19. And it does this for every loop. When doing this or anything similar you can save the computer some work dumping results into a variable first.  If we take anything away from this whole post, it's to at least move complex actions out of the test condition like so.

String[] someWords = {"Hello", "World"};
        int arrLen = someWords.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < arrLen ; i++) {
            System.out.println(someWords[i]);
        }

      15: aload_1
      16: arraylength
      17: istore_2
      18: iconst_0
      19: istore_3
      20: iload_3
      21: iload_2
      22: if_icmpge     40
      // do stuff code removed for compactness.
      34: iinc          3, 1
      37: goto          20

Here we've added 2 lines overall, but we've moved two more expensive instructions and replaced them with 1 cheaper one.   Relatively speaking of course.  Now we're just reloading an int value onto the stack instead of loading an array object onto the stack and then getting its length property.

Of course our best bet all around is going to be the reverse loop.  It does the same value caching without adding more code.  

 for (int i = someWords.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            System.out.println(someWords[i]);
        }

      15: aload_1
      16: arraylength
      17: iconst_1
      18: isub
      19: istore_2
      20: iload_2
      21: iflt          39
     // do stuff code removed for compactness.     
      33: iinc          2, -1
      36: goto          20

Again the biggest take away from all of this is always avoid complex actions in the test condition or inside the loop in general.

Now let's have a little fun.  We've shown for loops are just pretty do/while loops, but we can also play around with do/while loops a little too. Check this little bit of code.

 int i = 11;
        while (i --> 0) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }

A few things should stick out here.  Where's the decrement? What's the arrow? No seriously what's that arrow?  Don't look it up it doesn't exist.  This works in a surprising amount of C type languages.  It's actually (i-- > 0) with the spacing moved around.  The bytecode comes out the same except the decrement is at the top of the loop instead of the bottom.  Visually it's actually quite nice once you're used to it.  It's clearly showing the variable is going down to 0 in this loop. Other developers that don't know what it is are going to be confused by it though.  So avoid it for the sake of readability and maintainability.  But it also shows we can put the decrement in the while loop condition to save a line of code and not get penalized in the bytecode later.

K happy looping. Go save a few clock cycles.
